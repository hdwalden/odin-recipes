        <h3>Description</h3>
        Before the towns drew the peasants from the countryside to the factories, we had a saying: <i>“Na fia l’e nen da mariè sa l’è nen buna a fè i tajarin cun la pressia”</i> meaning: “a girl is not ready for marriage until she knows how to make tagliatelle”. Young farm girls enjoyed learning this skill. Their teachers were the grandmothers, the queens of the kitchen, who held on to their position as long as possible, even going as far as keeping their own daughters, married or not, out of the kitchen. These daughters were seen as possible usurpers and so the grandmothers directed their attention to the granddaughters who were not in the direct line of succession.
        <p>Several things were important for this handmade pasta: accurately measured ingredients, carefully rolling it out by hand using the prèssia, [rolling pin], and rapidly slicing the rolled up dough with an expert touch using a knife made from a piece of the siessa [scythe] used for cutting grass. Finally, but of great importance was the water in which to cook the tagliatelle: not hard, but the softer water one could find in a well.</p>
        It was considered almost compulsory to serve the tagliatelle with this liver sauce. Made from the livers expressly set aside from chickens and rabbits prepared for other dishes, it is a delicious sauce which sustains yet doesn’t overpower the flavour of the pasta. It is tangy and pairs well with the wines of the Alba area.
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g (5 cups) flour</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>

            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>rosemary</li>
            <li>3 chicken livers, finally chopped</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>100g (31/2 oz) ground lean veal</li>
            <li>240g (11/2 cups)  chopped canned tomatoes with their juice, or 60ml (4 tablespoons) tomato paste dissolved in 230ml (1 cup) hot water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the flour on the work top, make a well in the middle and break the eggs into it.</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of salt, 5ml (1 teaspoon) oil and knead until it becomes a firm dough.</li>
            <li> Rub the surface with oil and let stand for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Knead it again and then roll out into a thin sheet.</li>
            <li>Let it stand for a few minutes then dust it with cornmeal, roll it up and slice it into very thin ribbons.</li>
            <li>Unroll the strips and place them on a dish towel to dry.</li>
            <li>Cook the tajarin in boiling salted water for a few minutes, drain, and serve with the chicken liver sauce (recipe follows).</li>
        </ol>    

        <h5>Chicken liver sauce:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely chop the onion with the rosemary leaves and sauté until golden in the butter and oil.</li>
            <li>Add the finely chopped chicken livers and veal.</li>                <li>Let this mixture cook until browned, adding the broth a bit at a time, and adding more as it is cooked off.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato and continue cooking until the sauce has thickened.</li>     
        </ol>
        <p>Translator’s note: Prior to the final kneading the dough can be rolled up and sealed in plastic food wrap for 30 minutes. The same consistency is obtained without the risk of the dough drying out.</p>
